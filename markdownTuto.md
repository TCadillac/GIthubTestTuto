# Mark Down Tutorial
### _Italic_ and __Bold__
- To _italicize_, do `_code_`
- To __bold__, do `__code__`

### Header sizes
- Header size can be adjusted by the amount of `#` that precedes it
- `### Header_size3`
- `## Header_size2`

### Link
- Inline link are formmated like this: `[alt_text](link.com)`
- For example: 
	- `[Search for it.](www.google.com)`  
	[Search for it.](www.google.com)
	- `[You're __really, really__ going to want to see this.](www.dailykitten.com)`  
	[You're __really, really__ going to want to see this.](www.dailykitten.com)
	- `#### The Latest News from [the BBC](www.bcc.com/news)`
	#### The Latest News from [the BBC](www.bcc.com/news)

### Images
- Images are similar to inline links but just `!` before it like `![alt_text](image_link)`
- You can also reference it to keyword and link it to that keyword later such as:
	```
	![Black cat][Black]
	![Orange cat][Orange]
	[Black]: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/81_INF_DIV_SSI.jpg
	[Orange]: http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/google/noto-emoji-animals-nature/256/22221-cat-icon.png
	```

### Blockquotes
- If you need to call special attention to a quote, or design a pull quote. A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader
- To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the `>`
- For example:
	```
	I read this interesting quote the other day:
	> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"
	```

	I read this interesting quote the other day:
	> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

- If your quote spans multiple paragraphs, use `>` for every blank line such as:
	```
	> His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature. Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be? Stephen watched his face for some moments in silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, of his own loneliness which he feared.
	>
	> —Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length.
	>
	> Cranly did not answer.
	```

	> Cranly did not answer.

- Block quotes can contain other Markdown elements, such as italics, images, or links.

### Lists

- There are two types of lists in the known universe: unordered and ordered

#### Unordered
- To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list with an `*` or `-`. Each list item also gets its own line. For example:
	```
	* Milk
	* Eggs
	* Salmon
	* Butter
	```

	* Milk
	* Eggs
	* Salmon
	* Butter

#### Ordered
